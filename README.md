I've been really interested in this algorithm called Persistent Homology. PH is so simple and fast to compute but can do a lot of interesting things. It can discern any high-level topological features in a set of points (holes, voids, clusters, etc.) by connecting points that are within a given diameter parameter (which is what Iâ€™m adjusting). I made an incomplete demo of it cause it looks really pretty seeing it work, fun to look at and all. For my info, watch this well-made video on the algorithm: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0bnG1Wavag

This paper is a lost more mathematically rigorous, but has some interesting theorems (and pretty pictures): https://www.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/preprints/barcodes.pdf
